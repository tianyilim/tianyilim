### About Me
Hello! I'm Tianyi! I'm a robotics researcher at [DSO National Laboratories](https://www.dso.org.sg/), in Singapore ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬. 

I have a MSc in [Robotics, Systems, and Control](https://master-robotics.ethz.ch/) from ETH Zurich, and a BEng in [Electronic and Information Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/study/undergraduate/electronic-and-information-engineering/) from Imperial College London.

I am passionate about **robotics** &mdash; the union of computing, mathematics, electrical and mechanical engineering and more.

I am fluent in Python and C++. From various projects, internships and coursework, I also have experience in ROS(2) and Fusion 360.

### I'm currently working on
- World domination! Just kidding.

### Recent highlights
- Master's Thesis on pose-graph optimization for large-scale SLAM. It's [here on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16275)...
- Competing at ICRA23, ICRA24 and IROS24 F1TENTH Autonomous Grand Prix races with the [_ForzaETH_](https://www.forzaeth.ch/) team. We managed to [win first place](https://ee.ethz.ch/news-and-events/d-itet-news-channel/2023/06/center-for-project-based-learning-champions-of-the-f1tenth-competition-at-icra2023.html) in 2023 and delivered strong 3rd place finishes in both 2024 races!
- Helping to develop perception for L4 autonomous trucks with [Embotech](https://www.embotech.com/) as part of the _Safety, Systems, and Engineering_ team.
- A Monocular Visual Odometry (VO) pipeline with elements from OpenCV, built in Python. This was coursework for the [Vision Algorithms for Mobile Robotics](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/teaching.html) course at UZH.
- A path planner for autonomous cars using the [RRTx](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0278364915594679) algorithm. This was coursework for the [Planning and Decision-Making for Autonomous Robots](https://idsc.ethz.ch/education/lectures/PDM4AR.html) course at ETH. Check it out [here](https://github.com/tianyilim/RRTx).
- My Final Year Project at Imperial College on Multi-Robot path planning using a variation of the Dynamic Window Approach. The algorithms are written in Python and simulated in ROS/Gazebo. Check it out [here](https://github.com/tianyilim/ic-fyp)!
- I was also involved in Imperial's [Formula Student Artificial Intelligence](https://www.imeche.org/events/formula-student/team-information/fs-ai) competition where we hope to get our vehicle to autonomously detect and drive around a closed circuit demarcated by cones. Check out the organization on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/imperial-driverless/?trk=similar-pages) and [GitHub](https://github.com/Imperial-Driverless).
